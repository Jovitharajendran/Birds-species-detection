ABSTRACT:
The process of identifying bird species involves a systematic approach combining observation, analysis, and documentation. It begins with field observation, where the bird's physical characteristics, such as size, color, beak shape, and plumage patterns, are noted. Behavioural traits, such as flight patterns, feeding habits, and vocalizations, are also observed. The habitat plays a crucial role, as specific bird species are often found in particular environments like forests, wetlands, or urban areas. Photographs or sketches may be captured to aid in later identification. Using field guides or bird identification apps, these observations are compared against documented species. With the vast diversity of bird species on Earth, identifying each one by name becomes a challenging task, especially for non-experts. The variations in appearance, habitat, and behavior further complicate accurate recognition. There is a lot of process to classify the bird spices. This project focuses on the classification of bird species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, a type of deep learning model particularly effective for image recognition tasks. The primary process is to identify and categorize bird species based on images provided as input. Automate the process of species identification, which traditionally requires expert knowledge and manual effort. Preprocessing techniques, such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation, are applied to prepare the images for training.  The convolutional layers detect patterns and features such as edges, shapes, and textures, while pooling layers reduce dimensionality, making the computation efficient. By integrating modern Deep learning techniques, this project aims to provide a powerful tool for ornithologists and bird enthusiasts, facilitating the study and preservation of avian species.
